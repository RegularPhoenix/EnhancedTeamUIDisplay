Did you ever want to see what armour and accessories your allies are using, how many damage they deal? Maybe you want to compete with your friends? Or maybe you are a WoW player and like many useful(probably) info on your screen? If the answer is "Yes!" then Enhanced Team UI Display (ETUD) is what you need! ETUD adds fashionable UI that allows you to see overall and in-combat statictics.

Features:
	- Main ETUD panels: Shows HP, stat (MP, Ammo amount or healing potion cooldown depending on class) and respawn time of up to three teammates.
	- Buff check: Checks if all players have buffs that are recommended for their class.
	- Ally info panel: Shows armour, accessories and some stats like defence, health regenenration rate etc. of allies shown in main panels.
	- StatMeter: Shows current DPS and total damage received and dealt in a cirtain period of time.

Note: dps meter will not track dps of players without DPS Meter accessory equipped. Taken damage shows only damage taken from enemies. Environmental damage (fall, lava, etc.) does not count.

Default keybind - 'L'

Compatible with Calamity Mod
