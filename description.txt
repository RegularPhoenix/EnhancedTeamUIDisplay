Did you ever want to see what armour and accessories your allies are using, how much damage they deal? Maybe you want to compete with your friends? Or maybe you are a WoW player and like a lot of useful(probably) info on your screen? If the answer is "Yes!" then Enhanced Team UI Display (ETUD) is what you need! ETUD adds a fashionable UI that allows you to see overall and in-combat statistics.

Features:
	- Main ETUD panel: shows HP, stat (MP, Ammo amount or healing potion cooldown depending on class) and respawn time of up to three teammates.
	- Buff check: Check if all players have buffs that are recommended for their class.
	- Ally info panel: shows armour, accessories and some stats like defence, health regeneration rate etc. of allies shown in the main panels.
	- StatMeter: shows current DPS, total damage received and dealt in a certain period of time.

Note: the dps meter will not track the dps of players without a DPS Meter accessory equipped.

Default keybind - 'L'

Compatible with Calamity and Thorium mods.
